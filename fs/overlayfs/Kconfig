config OVERLAY_FS
	tristate "Overlay filesystem support"
	help
	  An overlay filesystem combines two filesystems - an 'upper' filesystem
	  and a 'lower' filesystem.  When a name exists in both filesystems, the
	  object in the 'upper' filesystem is visible while the object in the
	  'lower' filesystem is either hidden or, in the case of directories,
	  merged with the 'upper' object.

	  For more information see Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt

	help
